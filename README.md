# CitizenOne Node Web App Samples

These samples demonstrate how to add authentication to a Node.js application with CitizenOne. Each folder contains a distinct application so that various CitizenOne features can be viewed in isolation.

## What is CitizenOne?

CitizenOne is comprised of a series of modules and is available in a variety of licensing models to meet a wide range of deployment preferences. CitizenOne provides you with:

 * [Citizen Identity and Access Management](https://www.vivvo.com/citizen-identity-and-access-management/)
    * Creates a single profile managed by the citizen that can be used across all connected government services.

 * [Identity Relationship Management](https://www.vivvo.com/identity-relationship-management/)
